# Assembly

🌟 Welcome to my adorable little corner of Assembly exploration! UwU 🌟

✨ This GitHub repository is like §(*￣▽￣*)§ a cozy(and also disordered, LMAO) nook where I pour my heart into crafting simple programs in C, then lovingly reverse-engineer them using the powerful GDB. >_<

But that's not all – my real magic happens as I handcraft these marvels into **NASM x64 Assembly masterpieces!**(Or GNU Assembler(`as`)...? Anyway... they're all UwUish~><♥)(_OwO, Yeah, I try doing coding in Assembly, even though it's damn hard and not necessarily required._) 🎩🪄 I'm on a mission to level up my Assembly language understanding, and I'm dragging you along for the cutest ride! 🍬

From debugging to the delightful art of crafting compact Assembly programs, this repository is my personal treasure trove of learning moments. OwO 📚🖋️ Expect giggles and gasps as you witness my growth in wielding the Assembly enchantment.

So come on in, fellow adventurers! Let's explore, learn, and b(￣▽￣)d together as we decode the secrets of Assembly languages, one kawaii line of code at a time! 🌈🎉

> < Let the Assembly magic begin! b(￣▽￣)d

With love and code,

### How I study Assembly
10 minutes of coding in C language<br>
30 minutes of first coding in NASM x64 Assembly<br>
unlimited minutes of debugging and finding why the fuck does my code work so wrong, with GDB(debugger) and StackOverflow<br>
1 minute of tearfully successful moment<br>
1 minute of self-celebration<br>
10 minutes of pushing study records on this repository<br>
